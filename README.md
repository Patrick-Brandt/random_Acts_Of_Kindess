## Links: 
    Main Repo that we started with: [Main](https://github.com/MikeyP957/random_Acts_Of_Kindess.git).
    Forked copy that we transferred to: [Forked](https://github.com/Patrick-Brandt/random_Acts_Of_Kindess.git).
    Used this repo to to practice using Bulma framework:[Bulma Practice](https://github.com/Patrick-Brandt/randomActs-Bulma).

## Description:
    Here we created a webpage where Seattelites are able to connect with local charities and orgainzations based on their interests. They can select a variety of interests for example; animals, social issue, politcal organizations, etc. The user is able to choose whether to volunteer their time, donate money, donate used goods/food, etc. We have also included the use of Google Maps to enable the user to search which organizations are in close proximity to their location. 

## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Bulma
    - Bootstrap
    - Google Maps API
    - Charity API
    - Charity Navigator API

## Things we learned:
    ### When creating this website we ran into a few issues:
    
    - Github: We created a main branch to work on in GitHub but we were unsure of how to gain full access rights. The teamate who created this had to then leave for a few days on paternity which left us with out access to the github repo we created. The instructor told us then to fork the path which worked but left us with push/pull issues with all the teammates. 

    - Google Maps API: This API was diffuclt to gain access to. It wanted us to pay for the service and we had to find a way to work around this.
    
    - We had originally used Bootstrap in creating our website. When we were almost finished, we remembered that the assignment specified that we were to use a CSS framework that we were not taught in class (so not Bootstrap). We all researched different frameworks, and agreed on Bulma. We created another repository to practice using Bulma to recreate the website. It was reallt simple and easy to learn (mainly because the documentation is really easy for beginners to understand), so we went with it. Unfortunately, we ran into difficulties incorporating our Javascript into the new Bulma files. We had read articles warning against trying to use two different CSS frameworks in one project, but we tried it anyway. In the end, we ended up using Bootstrap Jumbotron, Bulma Navbar, and Bootstrap Carousel. We tested it out, and didn't notice any issues with styles or responsivity.
